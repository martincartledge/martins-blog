The tech industry is great at a lot of things, but instilling confidence is not always one of them.

If you are struggling with feeling comfortable in your place in the software industry, let me tell you this: *You are smart enough*.

Do you like coding? You are smart enough.

Do you enjoy CSS? You are smart enough.

Do you write bugs? You are smart enough.

Do you make mistakes? You are smart enough.

The software industry is not like what you see on NCIS.

There are so many different niches in this industry and it is not possible for one person to know it all.

If you are currently employed as a software developer, let me take a moment to tell you this: *You are smart enough to be where you are*.

Looking to break into the industry? Feel like you do not have what it takes? If you work hard at it, you will land a job, *You are smart enough*.

At the end of the day, we are all human beings.

No one has it all figured out.

It is okay not to know everything, no one ever will.

Being yourself is the best thing you can do.

Be comfortable in the things you know, and content with the things you do not know.

Your strengths are someone's weaknesses.

We all need each other.
