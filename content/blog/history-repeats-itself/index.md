It's Wednesday, January 6th, 2021.

Donald Trump still thinks the popular vote is merely a fantasy.

He has done nothing but spread lies and hatred to his supporters.

Shots were fired. 

People were killed.

Racial injustice is real.

White supremacy is real.

Together, we can stand against this vile administration.
