Picture this. Your manager comes to you and asks, *can you squeeze in some extra work before the big deadline?*

You *want* to be a team player, and impress upper management, but you are not sure you can *actually* pull it off.

You tell your manager *Sure thing, I can get that done no problem!*

Of course, what you are doing is not *wrong*, however, you can be establishing a new *expectation* without even realizing it.

The next time a last-minute ask or change in requirements surfaces, your manager will assume you can rise to the occasion because you did previously.

Before I continue, let me reiterate. *There is nothing wrong with going above and beyond at your job*.

With that being said, I think this can quickly turn into an issue if you do not feel comfortable with saying *No*.

Telling someone *No* is not a way to upset them or hurt their feelings. It is an honest answer that reflects how you feel.

If you do not feel confident about the new changes or added work before that big deadline, be honest about it!

You might think that your boss will be upset and take it out on you, but in reality, they will more than likely respect you more for being 100% honest and realistic.

Occasionally telling someone *No* is not only a healthy way to be fair to yourself, it also can help build trust amongst relationships of your peers or your boss.

When you trust someone, you feel happier to work with them, right? It is a no-brainer. Everyone can benefit from open communication and honesty.

It will not always be easy to say, but it will pay off in the end.

Be fair to yourself, say *No* more often.
